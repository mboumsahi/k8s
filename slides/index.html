            ### What is Ansible?

            - Orchestration tool
            - Agent/Daemon-less
            - Configures basically anything through **Modules**
              - Custom modules can be written
              - Wide range of community maintained modules
              - Are often executed remotely over SSH

            ---

            ---

            # 1
            #### Wordpress playbook using purely Resources
            For this assignment, we will deploy Wordpress. All required Kubernetes manifests have been provided in `wordpress/files` and should be applied to the XXX namespace, using a single task in a playbook at XXX.
            
            ---

            # 2 
            #### Wordpress role using Resources and Helm
            For this assignment, we will convert our XXX playbook into a role. We'll  also update it to use the HELM module to install MySQL with persistent storage.
            
            ---
                          
            # 3 
            #### Deploy Monitoring stack and add ServiceMonitor
            Now we have our role, we'll create a new playbook which uses it. We will also include the kube-prometheus-stack helm chart. Finally, we'll update our Wordpress role to deploy servicemonitor resources.
